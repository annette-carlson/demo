MARN 5895 - Research Computing final project

This repository houses files for the class demonstration of our final projecct. In our demonstration, we will teach the class to use the packages sklearn and statsmodels to conduct single and multiple linear regressions and calculate associated statistical values such as F-value, p-value, t-tests, variance inflation factor (VIF), and more. We are using data from Argo biogeochemical (BGC) floats in the Atlantic Ocean. Our linear models use temperature and salinity to predict pH. 

We will also briefly show some visualizations of BGC data across various Atlantic basins, as well as new code for simple 3-D visualizations of the data.
